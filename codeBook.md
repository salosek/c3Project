DATA DICTIONARY - COURSERA COURSE 3 - GETTING AND CLEANING DATA, COURSE PROJECT

using the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

This dictionary describes the tidy data set created in step 5 of the project. It contains the mean of each
variable from the extracted data set described in steps 1 and 2. The extracted variables include only 
measurements on the mean() and std() variable by activity and subject.

subjectCode,	                    values 1-30 representing the subject  in the group of 30 volunteers performing the activities
activityDescription,	            Activity Description; 1. WALKING, 2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4. SITTING, 5. STANDING, 6. LAYING

THE DATA VALUES FOR THE NEXT 66 VARABLES ARE THE MEAN OF THE RESPECTIVE SUBJECT, ACTIVITY GROUPING. EACH VARIABLE CONTAINS SIX
READINGS FOR EACH OF THE 30 SUBJECTS.
